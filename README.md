This program is a simple visual calculator made in Python.

If the "pygame" package is not installed, the program will not run. Download it using `pip install pygame`.

Running the file *calculator.py* should open a window with a calculator visible. To operate it, simply enter the desired operations using the buttons on the calculator, then press the *=* button. If the operation is invalid, `Error` will be displayed instead of an answer. Otherwise, the result will be displayed.

Note that the program uses a custom font (DS Digital) that needs to be installed for the same visual result.
